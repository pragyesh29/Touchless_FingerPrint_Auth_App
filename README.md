# Touchless_FingerPrint_Auth_App

## Abstract
Biometric authentication, particularly fingerprint recognition, has become increasingly vital in today's digital landscape. It offers a more secure and convenient means of verifying individual identities compared to traditional methods like passwords or PINs.

## Problem Being Addressed
Conventional Fingerprint authentication methods require touch-based fingerprint scanning mechanism for authentication which often pose challenges such as **hygiene concerns**, especially after pandemic due to COVID and vulnerability to spoofing attacks.
Also, with touch-based fingerprint authentication a **dedicated scanning device was also required** in order to scan the fingerprint of the user, hence it was **not very scalable**.

## Objective
To develop and implement a Touchless Fingerprint Authentication Application using Convolutional Neural Networks by leveraging image processing and **Deep Learning techniques** to improve convenience, hygiene and security of biometric authentication process.
The Android Application system which has been developed over this course of this duration is capable of classifying a user as “Genuine” or “Forged” based on the image of his/her **left hand’s index finger** provided by the user.

## Techstack Used

### Deep Learning
* Python (For model training purpose)
* keras
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* VGG16 (A popular Deep Learning Architecture)
* Transfer Learning
* Image Processing
### Andriod Application Development
* XML (For developing User Interface of the Application)
* Kotlin (For writing buisness logic of the Application)
